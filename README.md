IoT - COMP11061

Scenario
Your company, Universal Widget Systems, has been engaged to build and demonstrate a
Proof of Concept (POC) to an SME “We Grow Things”, which has recently noticed that it’s
hydroponic nutrient management system (HNMS) is not working as effectively as hoped. It
is believed by the engineers at “Plants are Us”, the manufactures of the HNMS, that the
difference in temperature between the greenhouse and the equipment room is affecting
the efficiency of the HNMS. Your POC should measure, and report the temperature both
inside and outside the equipment room, record entry to equipment room and control an air
conditioning unit within the equipment room (to maintain a workable balance between the
growing room and the equipment room). The HNMS is managed by a separate system which
your POC may later be required to connect with, but that is currently outside the scope of
this POC.

Section One of the coursework requires students to design and build a POC that takes two
separate temperature measurements, records the use of RFID tags used to gain access to
this equipment room, and monitor and manage an air conditioning unit that has been
recently installed, as illustrated in the diagram supplied, to document and demonstrate their
operation to a member of teaching staff.

Requirements
Build and configure a prototype to meet the requirements in the diagram above.
1. Record the temperature/pressure in the growing area.
2. Record the temperature in the equipment room.
3. Record entry to the equipment room.
4. If the temperature difference is more than 2˚Centigrade then either heating
or cooling of the equipment room is performed.
5. Report and record the results to a suitable IoT management system.
6. The IoT management system (Dashboard) shows the status of the air
conditioning system and can remotely override the POC hardware
